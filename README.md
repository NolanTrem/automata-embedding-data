# Automata Embedding Data Repository

This repository contains the pre-generated embedding data used in the Automata project. The Automata project requires embeddings for various aspects of its operation, and these are kept in this repository for easy management and versioning.

The embeddings are stored in a `ChromaSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`, which is a customized data store based on the Chroma vector database. This database stores key-value pairs, where the key is a symbol from the codebase and the value is an embedding vector that represents this symbol in a high-dimensional space. 

## Usage

This repository is included as a Git submodule in the main Automata repository. To include the embeddings in your local copy of Automata, clone the repository with the `--recurse-submodules` option:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/emrgnt-cmplxty/automata.git
```

If you've already cloned the repository, you can fetch the submodule with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

In the Automata code, the embeddings are accessed using the `ChromaSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase` class. For example, to get an embedding for a particular symbol, use the `get()` method:

```python
key = parse_symbol('your_symbol_here')
embedding = embedding_database.get(key)
```

You can also add, update, and batch process entries using the methods provided by `ChromaSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`.
